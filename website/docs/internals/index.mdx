# OpenRecipe Internals

This section covers the internals of OpenRecipe and explains how
plans are generated, the lifecycle of a provider, etc. The goal
of this section is to remove any notion of "magic" from OpenRecipe.
We want you to be able to trust and understand what OpenRecipe is
doing to function.

-> **Note:** Knowledge of OpenRecipe internals is not
required to use OpenRecipe. If you aren't interested in the internals
of OpenRecipe, you may safely skip this section.
