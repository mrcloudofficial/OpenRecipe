# CLI Authentication

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Authenticate the CLI with OpenRecipe Cloud](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-login?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

[OpenRecipe Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) and
[OpenRecipe Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise) are platforms that perform
OpenRecipe runs to provision infrastructure, offering a collaboration-focused
environment that makes it easier for teams to use OpenRecipe together. (For
expediency, the content below refers to both products as "OpenRecipe Cloud.")

OpenRecipe CLI integrates with OpenRecipe Cloud in several ways — it can be a
front-end for [CLI-driven runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/cli) in OpenRecipe Cloud,
and can also use OpenRecipe Cloud as a state backend and a private module
registry. All of these integrations require you to authenticate OpenRecipe CLI
with your OpenRecipe Cloud account.

The best way to handle CLI authentication is with the `login` and `logout`
commands, which help automate the process of getting an API token for your
OpenRecipe Cloud user account.
