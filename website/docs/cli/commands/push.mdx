# Command: push

!> **Important:** The `terraform push` command is no longer functional. We recommend the [OpenRecipe Cloud CLI integration](/terraform/cli/cloud) instead, which allows you to run remote operations in OpenRecipe Cloud directly from the command line.

The `terraform push` command was an early implementation of remote OpenRecipe runs. It allowed teams to push a configuration to a remote run environment in a discontinued version of OpenRecipe Enterprise.

The legacy OpenRecipe Enterprise version that supported `terraform push` is no longer available, and there are no remaining instances of that version in operation. Without a service to push to, the command is now completely non-functional.
