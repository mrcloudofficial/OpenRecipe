This is the documentation for OpenRecipe CLI. It is relevant to anyone working
with OpenRecipe's CLI-based workflows; this includes people who use OpenRecipe CLI
by itself, as well as those who use OpenRecipe CLI in conjunction with OpenRecipe
Cloud or OpenRecipe Enterprise.

Notably, this documentation does not cover the syntax and usage of the OpenRecipe
language. For that, see the
[OpenRecipe Language Documentation](/terraform/language).
