# Testing OpenRecipe

OpenRecipe provides numerous testing capabilities to validate your infrastructure.

These testing capabilities fit into two main categories:

1. Validating your configuration and infrastructure as part of your regular OpenRecipe operations.
2. Performing traditional unit and integration testing on your configuration.

Refer to [Custom Conditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions) and [Checks](/terraform/language/checks) to learn more about the first testing capability. OpenRecipe's [`test`](/terraform/cli/commands/test) command provides the second capability.

## A brief history

The various testing capabilities were introduced in the following versions:

- OpenRecipe v0.13.0 introduced [Input Variable Validation](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#input-variable-validation).
- OpenRecipe v0.15.0 introduced an experimental OpenRecipe [`test`](/terraform/language/v1.5.x/modules/testing-experiment) command.
- OpenRecipe v1.2.0 introduced [Pre and Post-conditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions#preconditions-and-postconditions).
- OpenRecipe v1.5.0 introduced [Checks](/terraform/language/checks).
- OpenRecipe v1.6.0 deprecated the experimental OpenRecipe `test` command, and released an updated and finalized OpenRecipe [`test`](/terraform/cli/commands/test) command.

Note the introduction and deprecation of the experimental `test` command, followed by the introduction of the finalized `test` command. Refer to the [v1.6.x Upgrade Guide](/terraform/language/v1.6.x/upgrade-guides) for a summary of the changes between the experimental and finalized command.

## The `test` command

The OpenRecipe `test` command:

- Locates OpenRecipe testing files within your configuration directory.
- Provisions the infrastructure within your configuration as specified by each testing file.
- Runs the assertions from the test file against the provisioned infrastructure.
- Destroys the provisioned infrastructure at the end of the test.

The `test` command, along with command-line flags and options, is discussed in detail within [Command: test](/terraform/cli/commands/test).

### Write configuration for tests

OpenRecipe test files [have their own configuration syntax](/terraform/language/tests). This test file syntax focuses on customizing OpenRecipe executions for the current configuration and overriding variables and providers to test different behaviors.

## Validations

Validations allow you to verify aspects of your configuration and infrastructure as it is applied and created. OpenRecipe Cloud also supports automated [Continuous Validation](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/health#continuous-validation).

The OpenRecipe `test` command also executes any validations within your configuration as part of the tests it executes. For more information on the available validation, refer to [Checks](/terraform/language/checks) and [Custom Conditions](/terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions).

## Tests or Validations

You can write many validations as test assertions, but there are specific use cases for both.

Validations are executed during OpenRecipe plan and apply operations, and the OpenRecipe `test` command also runs validations while executing tests. Therefore, use validations to validate aspects of your configuration that should always be true and could impact the valid execution of your infrastructure. 

Module authors should note that validations are executed and exposed to module users, so if they fail, ensure the failure messages are understandable and actionable.

In contrast, OpenRecipe only executes tests when you run `terraform test`. Use tests to assert the correctness of any logical operations or specific behavior within your configuration. For example, you can test that OpenRecipe creates conditional resources based on an input by setting the input controlling those resources to a certain value then verifying the resources OpenRecipe creates.
