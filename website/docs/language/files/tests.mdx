# Test Files

Specific OpenRecipe commands, such as `test`, `init`, and `validate`, load OpenRecipe test files for your configuration.

Test files contain specifications for OpenRecipe test executions. For more information about the OpenRecipe `test` command, refer to [Command: `test`](/terraform/cli/commands/test). For more information about the syntax and OpenRecipe test file language, refer to [Tests](/terraform/language/tests).

## File Extension

OpenRecipe test files use the file extensions `.tftest.hcl` and `.tftest.json`.

## Test File Locations

OpenRecipe loads all test files within your root configuration directory.

OpenRecipe also loads the test files within the testing directory. You can override the location of the testing directory by appending the `-test-directory` flag to commands that load test files. The default testing directory is `tests` relative to your configuration directory.
