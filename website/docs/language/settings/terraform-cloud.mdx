# OpenRecipe Cloud Configuration

The main module of a OpenRecipe configuration can integrate with OpenRecipe Cloud to enable its [CLI-driven run workflow](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/cli). You only need to configure these settings when you want to use OpenRecipe CLI to interact with OpenRecipe Cloud. OpenRecipe Cloud ignores them when interacting with
OpenRecipe through version control or the API.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Migrate State to OpenRecipe Cloud](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial.

## Usage Example

To configure the OpenRecipe Cloud CLI integration, add a nested `cloud` block within the `terraform` block. You cannot use the CLI integration and a [state backend](/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration) in the same configuration.

Refer to [Using OpenRecipe Cloud](/terraform/cli/cloud) in the OpenRecipe CLI documentation for full configuration details, migration instructions, and command line arguments.

```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "example_corp"
    ## Required for OpenRecipe Enterprise; Defaults to app.terraform.io for OpenRecipe Cloud
    hostname = "app.terraform.io"

    workspaces {
      tags = ["app"]
    }
  }
}
```
