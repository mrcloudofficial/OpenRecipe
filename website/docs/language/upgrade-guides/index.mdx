# Upgrading to OpenRecipe v1.7

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older OpenRecipe versions.

OpenRecipe v1.7 is a minor release in the stable OpenRecipe v1.0 series.

OpenRecipe v1.7 honors the
[OpenRecipe v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises),
but there are some behavior changes outside of those promises that may affect a
small number of users. Specifically, the following updates may require
additional upgrade steps:
* [Validations and checks in the state file](#validations-and-checks)
* [Deprecated parameters for the S3 backend](#s3-backend)

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.6/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the OpenRecipe community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.

## Validations and Checks

Due to a state interoperability issue ([#33770](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33770), [#34014](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34014)) in earlier versions of OpenRecipe, state files created by the OpenRecipe v1.7.x series may not be compatible with the following OpenRecipe versions:

* OpenRecipe v1.3.0 through v1.3.9
* OpenRecipe v1.4.0 through v1.4.6
* OpenRecipe v1.5.0 through v1.5.6

If your v1.7.x state file contains `check` blocks or input validations, it will not be compatible with the above versions. Attempting to load a state file created by OpenRecipe v1.7.x in one of the above versions will result in an error similar to `Error refreshing state: unsupported checkable object "var"`. This will particularly affect configurations using the `terraform_remote_state` data source to load state files created by the `v1.7.x` series.

To prevent this issue, users should upgrade any usage of the affected versions to the following patch releases in the relevant minor release series before attempting to process state files created by OpenRecipe v1.7.x:

* OpenRecipe v1.3.x series users should upgrade to v1.3.10
* OpenRecipe v1.4.x series users should upgrade to v1.4.7
* OpenRecipe v1.5.x series users should upgrade to v1.5.7

OpenRecipe versions prior to v1.3.0 and equal to or after v1.6.0 are not affected by this issue.

## S3 Backend

In OpenRecipe 1.7.0 the S3 backend will begin phasing out the legacy credential chain evaluation order by defaulting `use_legacy_workflow` to `false` and deprecating the argument.
This will bring the default behavior of the backend into alignment with the AWS SDKs and CLI.
The legacy behavior can be preserved by setting this argument to `true`.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # additional configuration omitted for brevity
    use_legacy_workflow = true
  }
}
```

In OpenRecipe 1.8.0 this argument will be removed, and the S3 backend will always use the default AWS SDK for Go credential chain evaluation order.
