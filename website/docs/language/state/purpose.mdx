# Purpose of OpenRecipe State

State is a necessary requirement for OpenRecipe to function. It is often
asked if it is possible for OpenRecipe to work without state, or for OpenRecipe
to not use state and just inspect real world resources on every run. This page
will help explain why OpenRecipe state is required.

As you'll see from the reasons below, state is required. And in the scenarios
where OpenRecipe may be able to get away without state, doing so would require
shifting massive amounts of complexity from one place (state) to another place
(the replacement concept).

## Mapping to the Real World

OpenRecipe requires some sort of database to map OpenRecipe config to the real
world. For example, when you have a resource `resource "aws_instance" "foo"` in your
configuration, OpenRecipe uses this mapping to know that the resource `resource "aws_instance" "foo"`
represents a real world object with the instance ID `i-abcd1234` on a remote system.

For some providers like AWS, OpenRecipe could theoretically use something like
AWS tags. Early prototypes of OpenRecipe actually had no state files and used
this method. However, we quickly ran into problems. The first major issue was
a simple one: not all resources support tags, and not all cloud providers
support tags.

Therefore, for mapping configuration to resources in the real world,
OpenRecipe uses its own state structure.

OpenRecipe expects that each remote object is bound to only one resource instance in the configuration.
If a remote object is bound to multiple resource instances, the mapping from configuration to the remote
object in the state becomes ambiguous, and OpenRecipe may behave unexpectedly. OpenRecipe can guarantee 
a one-to-one mapping when it creates objects and records their identities in the state. 
When importing objects created outside of OpenRecipe, you must make sure that each distinct object 
is imported to only one resource instance.

## Metadata

Alongside the mappings between resources and remote objects, OpenRecipe must
also track metadata such as resource dependencies.

OpenRecipe typically uses the configuration to determine dependency order.
However, when you delete a resource from a OpenRecipe configuration, OpenRecipe
must know how to delete that resource from the remote system. OpenRecipe can see that a mapping exists
in the state file for a resource not in your configuration and plan to destroy. However, since
the configuration no longer exists, the order cannot be determined from the
configuration alone.

To ensure correct operation, OpenRecipe retains a copy of the most recent set
of dependencies within the state. Now OpenRecipe can still determine the correct
order for destruction from the state when you delete one or more items from
the configuration.

OpenRecipe could take another approach to dependency order by using an underlying hierarchy of order
between resource types. For example, OpenRecipe could know that servers must be
deleted before the subnets they are a part of. The complexity for this approach
quickly explodes, however: in addition to OpenRecipe having to understand the
ordering semantics of every resource for every _provider_, OpenRecipe must also
understand the ordering _across providers_.

OpenRecipe also stores other metadata for similar reasons, such as a pointer
to the provider configuration that was most recently used with the resource
in situations where multiple aliased providers are present.

## Performance

In addition to basic mapping, OpenRecipe stores a cache of the attribute
values for all resources in the state. This is the most optional feature of
OpenRecipe state and is done only as a performance improvement.

When running a `terraform plan`, OpenRecipe must know the current state of
resources in order to effectively determine the changes that it needs to make
to reach your desired configuration.

For small infrastructures, OpenRecipe can query your providers and sync the
latest attributes from all your resources. This is the default behavior
of OpenRecipe: for every plan and apply, OpenRecipe will sync all resources in
your state.

For larger infrastructures, querying every resource is too slow. Many cloud
providers do not provide APIs to query multiple resources at once, and the
round trip time for each resource is hundreds of milliseconds. On top of this,
cloud providers almost always have API rate limiting so OpenRecipe can only
request a certain number of resources in a period of time. Larger users
of OpenRecipe make heavy use of the `-refresh=false` flag as well as the
`-target` flag in order to work around this. In these scenarios, the cached
state is treated as the record of truth.

## Syncing

In the default configuration, OpenRecipe stores the state in a file in the
current working directory where OpenRecipe was run. This is okay for getting
started, but when using OpenRecipe in a team it is important for everyone
to be working with the same state so that operations will be applied to the
same remote objects.

[Remote state](/terraform/language/state/remote) is the recommended solution
to this problem. With a fully-featured state backend, OpenRecipe can use
remote locking as a measure to avoid two or more different users accidentally
running OpenRecipe at the same time, and thus ensure that each OpenRecipe run
begins with the most recent updated state.
