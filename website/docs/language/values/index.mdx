# Variables and Outputs

The OpenRecipe language includes a few kinds of blocks for requesting or
publishing named values.

- [Input Variables](/terraform/language/values/variables) serve as parameters for
  a OpenRecipe module, so users can customize behavior without editing the source.

- [Output Values](/terraform/language/values/outputs) are like return values for a
  OpenRecipe module.

- [Local Values](/terraform/language/values/locals) are a convenience feature for
  assigning a short name to an expression.
